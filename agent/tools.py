Tool Schema Definitions

This module defines the tool schemas that the LLM can see and call.
These are the "interfaces" for statistical analysis tools - the actual
implementations are handled in the analysis/ directory.

The LLM sees these tool schemas to understand what statistical analyses
are available and what parameters they need. Only high-level statistical
tests are exposed; diagnostic checks are handled internally within each test.

    Recommend interesting AND feasible tests for a given family.

    This is a schema-only tool (the body doesn't run). The actual logic runs in a
    state-aware node so it can access df/metadata and (later) an OSS LLM + RAG.

    Args:
        test_family: One of "t_test", "anova", "correlation", "chi_square".
        top_k: Maximum number of recommendations to return (default 5).

    Returns:
        JSON string with a list of recommendations. Each item will typically include:
          - test_family
          - variables (e.g., {"group_col": "...", "value_col": "..."})

    - Check for missing data and handle appropriately
    - Test normality of residuals (Shapiro-Wilk)
    - Test homogeneity of variances (Levene's test)
